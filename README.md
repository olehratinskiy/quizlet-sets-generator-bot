## üìñ About
The idea of this bot is to make it easier for Quizlet users to create sets of words automatically. The bot logs into an account, changes the settings of a set, and fills it with unknown words. Users can send text messages with words that should be in the future set or send images to make the bot recognize terms and add them too.
